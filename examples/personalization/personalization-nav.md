#Personalization - Navigation
##Overview
There are many instances where marketers are faced with trying to stuff all the potential calls to action for various user types on one page. For instance, displaying a log in button for visitors that are not currently members can be confusing and lead to a bad experience. Likewise, if I am already registered I don't want to sign up. It shows that you really don't know me and makes the task of logging in a bit more difficult. With Lytics you can remove the uknown and display calls to action based on segment membership.
